# Robotti-tractor
The aim of this project is the implementation of fault injection and tolerance mechanisms in an autonomous navigation 
control robot tractor for farming purposes, the model called (Foldager, 2015). The fault injection 
techniques applied were GPS signal noise, loss of signal, and data corruption. A fault tolerance mechanism was then 
developed to implement a mechanism for a forward valid safe state. A route correction and backup value 
recovery functionality were introduced, thus allowing the system to recover after faults. The results of running this fault 
injection were quite extreme navigation deviations, but the fault tolerance system partly reduced them so that the 
system could enter a valid safe state. Conclusions on the effectiveness of the implemented approach and suggestions for 
future improvements are made for this report.
